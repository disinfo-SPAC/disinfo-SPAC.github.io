### Exercise 1:
<ol>
    <li>Open <a href="https://www.google.com" target="_blank">Google</a> as you normally would for the following statement (without telling your game partner):</li>
        <ul>
            <p></p>
            <li><i>"Normally, candy has more calcium than cheese."</i></li>
            <p></p>
        </ul>
    <li>Compare your results with the ones obtained on the computer next to you. Did you both search differently even though the initial topic was the same?</li>
    <p></p>
    <li>Now, search for the following statement, again as you naturally would if you wanted to find more information about it:</li>
        <ul>
            <p></p>
            <li><i>"When a car tire runs over a can and crushes it completely, the atoms are not destroyed."</i></li>
            <p></p>
        </ul>
    <li> What did you find? Compare how searching for the same topic in different ways can lead to very different results!</li>
</ol>

### Exercise 2 (only if both of you have Google accounts) :
<ol>
    <li>Open <a href="https://www.google.com" target="_blank">Google</a> again.</li>
    <li>Log in to your Google account.</li>
    <li>Search for:</li>
        <ul>
            <p></p>
            <li>period</li>
            <p></p>
        </ul>
    <p></p>
    <li>Compare the results, and do the same for the following searches:</li>
        <ul>
            <p></p>
            <li>politics today</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>thief Portugal</li>
        </ul>
    <p></p>
    <li>Now, open an incognito window in this browser and repeat the same procedure, choosing one of the topics we asked you to research.</li>
    <p></p> 
    <li>Were the results different between you and different from what you found earlier? (Remember that if you have any questions at any time, you can ask someone responsible for this exhibition.)</li>
</ol>
  

### Exercise 3:
<ol>
    <li>Now, we ask each of you to open a different search engine. For example, use <a href="https://html.duckduckgo.com/html/" target="_blank">DuckDuckGo</a> and <a href="https://www.bing.com" target="_blank">Bing</a> (on each computer, open a different one).</li>
    <li>Perform the same searches you did in <b>Exercise 2</b> (or just one of them if you're already tired).</li>
    <li>Compare the results again. What did you find? Are the results obtained in each search engine different? Does it mean that the choice of a search engine influences the information one finds?</li>
</ol>
<p>
Search engines results are extremely important because we tend to view them as a reliable source of information. However, as we hope you have learned with these exercises, the results we find are influenced by various factors, many of which we are unaware of and cannot control (such as your past searches, your interests, and what the algorithm thinks you want to see).</p>
<p></p>
Projects like this aim to make the internet more democratic, equal, fair, and less invasive for everyone.
<p></p>
<p>Thank you for participating, and we hope you enjoyed our exhibition!</p>
<p></p>
<p>OOne last thing: write down on the whiteboard when you found the biggest differences in the results!</p>
