### Exercise 1:
<ol>
    <li>Open<a href="https://www.google.com" target="_blank">Google</a> as you normally would (without telling your game partner) for the following statement:</li>
        <ul>
            <p></p>
            <li><i>"NASA Confirmed That Earth Has A New Moon"</i></li>
            <p></p>
        </ul>
    <li>Compare your results with the ones obtained on the computer next to you. Did you both search differently even though the initial topic was the same?</li>
    <p></p>
    <li>Now, search for the following statement, again as you naturally would if you wanted to find more information about it:</li>
        <ul>
            <p></p>
            <li><i>"Receipts with easily erasable ink contain cancer- and infertility inducing substances, study finds"</i></li>
            <p></p>
        </ul>
    <li> What did you find? Compare how searching for the same topic in different ways can lead to very different results!</li>
</ol>

### Exercise 2 (only if both of you have Google accounts) :
<ol>
    <li>Open <a href="https://www.google.com" target="_blank">Google</a> again.</li>
    <li>Log in to your Google account.</li>
    <li>Search for:</li>
        <ul>
            <p></p>
            <li>covid hoax</li>
            <p></p>
        </ul>
    <p></p>
    <li>Compare the results, and do the same for the following searches:</li>
        <ul>
            <p></p>
            <li>politics today</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>thief Portugal</li>
        </ul>
    <p></p>
    <li>Now, open an incognito window in this browser and repeat the same procedure, choosing one of the topics we asked you to research.</li>
    <p></p> 
    <li>Were the results different between you and different from what you found earlier? (Remember that if you have any questions at any time, you can ask someone responsible for this exhibition.)</li>
</ol>
  

### Exercise 3:
<ol>
    <li>Now, we ask each of you to open a different search engine. For example, use <a href="https://duckduckgo.com" target="_blank">DuckDuckGo</a> and <a href="https://www.bing.com" target="_blank">Bing</a> (on each computer, open a different one).</li>
    <li>Perform the same searches you did in <b>Exercise 2</b> (or just one of them if you're already tired).</li>
    <li>Compare the results again. How about that? Are the results obtained in each search engine different? Does it mean that the choice of a search engine influences the information each of you receives?
</ol>
<p>
The links we find in search engines are extremely important because we tend to view search engine results as a reliable source of information. However, as we hope you have seen in these exercises, the results we find are influenced by various factors, many of which we are unaware of and cannot control (such as your past searches, your interests, and what the algorithm thinks you want to see).</p>
<p></p>
Projects like this aim to make the internet more democratic, equal, fair, and less invasive for everyone.
<p></p>
<p>Thank you for participating, and we hope you enjoyed our exhibition!</p>
<p></p>
<p>Mark on the board where you found the most differences in the results!</p>
