title: Testing the search engines
---

This is the part where we ask you to test the search engine algorithms.

We want you to, in pairs, test various aspects that can influence the results you encounter on your favorite search engine. Note that differences in results are not only differences in the links you find, but also their order. People tend to pay more attention to the first three results retrived by the search engines, therefore, any difference in this order can be higly significant. 

Also note that we will be storing the results that are suggested to you during this activity. However, it's even more important that you know that we will not be storing any personal information. If you want to learn more about the exact data we will be collecting, click on the upper right corner on "DATA COLLECTED."

Are you ready? Is your companion on the other computer ready to start as well?
