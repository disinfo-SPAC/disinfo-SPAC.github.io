title: Testing the search engines
subtitle: Are you ready?
---
<p>* This is the part where we ask you to test the search engine algorithms.</p>
<p>* We are particularly interested in testing search engines because (1) they have received less attention from researchers, and (2) because people tend to place a lot of trust in the results they find in them.</p>
<p>* In this activity, we want you, in pairs, to test with us several aspects that can influence the results you get when you query your favorite search engine.</p>
<p>* Note that the differences in the results you find are significant not only when the links themselves are different, but also when their order is different, since we tend to pay more attention to the first three suggested results!</p>
<p>* Please keep in mind that we will save all the results that are suggested to you. However, it's even more important for you to know that we will <b>not save any personal information</b>.  If you want to learn more about the data we will be collecting, click on <a href="https://disinfo-spac.github.io/datacollected">Collected Data</a>.</p>

<p>Are you ready? Is your partner on the other computer ready as well?</p>
